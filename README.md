# Converter

So far, I have only worked by modifying directly the files of the eu4 converter, located in :
Wherever you installed your game/Crusader Kings 2/dlc/dlc030.zip

If you want to test it, take the
culture_table.csv, religion_table.csv and province_table.csv files and put them in your dlc030.zip
Backup the file first, of course.

Please tell me if there is any culture/religion/province in ck2 think should be linked to another one. I am far from an expert on the field ^^

All progress done so far is listed in the file 'Progress'.
